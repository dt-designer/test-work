# Test Work

No need to install third-party libraries. Standard methods from the Angular box are used. For proper operation, you need to register work with workers in config, below is an example for setting up a worker in a clean Angular project. I took the styles from Bootstrap (I admit, I use these styles for test tasks, so I took a ready-made file and edited it).


Install dependencies:
`npm install -g @angular/cli@15`
When installing, you must select `SCSS` as a CSS preprocessor
